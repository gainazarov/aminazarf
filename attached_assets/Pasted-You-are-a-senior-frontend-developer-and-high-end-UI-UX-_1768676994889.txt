You are a senior frontend developer and high-end UI/UX designer.

Create a premium one-page landing website for a homeware & tableware store called "Amina Zarf".

⚠️ IMPORTANT:
- Frontend only (NO backend).
- One-page website with dynamic category switching.
- The design MUST closely follow the attached reference style.
- The website must feel like a luxury editorial catalog, not a typical online shop.

DESIGN STYLE (CRITICAL)
────────────────────────
The design is inspired by premium European home & lifestyle brands.

Visual characteristics:

- Calm, emotional, slow design
- No sharp contrasts or aggressive colors

Color palette:
- Warm beige
- Milk white
- Light sand
- Soft brown
- Subtle gold accents (very minimal)

Typography:
- Headings: elegant serif font (high fashion / editorial style)
- Body text: clean modern sans-serif
- Large headings with generous letter spacing
- Minimal text, focus on visuals

Spacing & layout:
- Very large vertical spacing between sections
- Wide margins, lots of white space
- Content should “breathe”
- Grid layouts inspired by photo galleries
- Uneven image grids (editorial look)

Images:
- Lifestyle photos with people using tableware
- Close-up shots of plates, glasses, ceramics
- Soft focus, warm tones
- Images are more important than text
